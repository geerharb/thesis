The three images are the same fluid seperated in time. The interface between liquid and gas evolves in time as each globule will interact with neighboring globules. If the temperature is increased past the critical point, the globules shrink in size to the point the plots appear as white noise. Two opposing forces are at work near the critical point: entropy and energy. The universe prefers a lower energy state, and so the surface area of the liquid prefers to be minimized. Unfortunately as the temperature is increased the density of the liquid goes down while the density of the vapor goes up; which means the surface tension decreases as the temperature reaches the critical point. Near the critical point the surface tension is no longer sufficient to keep the liquid seperate from the gas, as such the liquid and gas start to mix and in the process entropy increases. Another way to think about the mixing is through density fluctuations. Both the liquid and gas will have density fluctuations, and as the critical point is reached the density of the gas approaches the density of the liquid, which means the density fluctuations of the gas will be enough to convert some regions into a liquid and vice versa.}\relax }}{6}}

Running simulations with every possible filling fraction will indeed produce a nice data set(see figure A), but this will come at the cost of a lengthy computation time. Instead, pairs of simulations are run around filling fractions of [0.5,0.15,0.25,0.35,0.45] (see figure B); the idea is each pair of simulations can be used to interpolate the thermodynamic observables to the selected filling fractions. The comparisons to SAFT are only applied at the selected filling fractions.}\relax }}{18}}

The left and right set of plots shows how the signal to noise ratio changes as the temperature increases. Far from the critical point the signal is relatively strong, while the near the critical point the noise becomes significant. To prevent the loss of the signal, first start at a low temperature where the signal is strong. Then gradually increase the temperature while finding common tangents. As the temperature and noise increases, the previous solutions at a slightly lower temperature can be used as a guess for the new higher temperature.}\relax }}{19}}

Both sets of graphs show that a small box size has a higher energy than SAFT, while a larger box will have a lower energy than SAFT. This makes sense because as the box size increases longer wavelength fluctuations are allowed, and these longer wavelengths actually lower the allowed energy due to the decreased interactions in the low density regions being more than compensated by the increase in interactions in the high density regions. Given a constant box size, the high filling fraction simulations cannot fluctuate as much as the low filling fraction simulations, which explains the bulge in the two lower plots.}\relax }}{20}}

It is interesting to see the entropy trends are nearly the inverse of the heat capacity trends. Both entropy and heat capacity require a derivative to find, it is just that entropy is the negative derivative of Free energy while heat capacity is the positive derivative of internal energy. Given fig. 3.1\hbox {} showed the internal and free energy spread out in a similar fashion as the temperature was increased, it isn't surprising entropy and heat capacity have inverse trends. Regarding the trend itself, the graphs suggest entropy of a small box will have more entropy than SAFT, while a large box will have a lower entropy than SAFT. This trend can be explained by the particles binding together in ways that SAFT could not take into account, and this extra binding will decrease the entropy simply because some configurations are now favored over other configurations.}\relax }}{21}}
