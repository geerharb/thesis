Generalized renormalization group theory (GRG) builds on Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) by incorporating correlations at progressively longer length scales. SAFT itself already includes correlations at some unkown length scale $L$ from which GRG is applied, which means GRG is left with an unknown parameter which is usually fit to experimental data. Rather than using best fits with experimental data, this project attempts a best fit between SAFT and Monte Carlo simulations of various box sizes to find the unknown parameter $L$. The idea is Monte Carlo simulations with a box side length of $L$ can only incorporate correlations of length scale $L$, so these Monte Carlo simulations should recreate the results of SAFT.
