\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces \relax \fontsize {8}{9.5}\selectfont \textbf {Here a simulation of a 2d fluid near the critical point is presented. The three images are the same fluid separated in time. The interface between liquid and gas evolves in time as each globule will interact with neighboring globules. If the temperature is increased past the critical point, the globules shrink in size to the point the plots appear as white noise. Two opposing forces are at work near the critical point: entropy and energy. The universe prefers a lower energy state, and so the surface area of the liquid prefers to be minimized. Unfortunately as the temperature is increased the density of the liquid goes down while the density of the vapor goes up; which means the surface tension decreases as the temperature reaches the critical point. Near the critical point the surface tension is no longer sufficient to keep the liquid separate from the gas, as such the liquid and gas start to mix and in the process entropy increases. Another way to think about the mixing is through density fluctuations. Both the liquid and gas will have density fluctuations, and as the critical point is reached the density of the gas approaches the density of the liquid, which means the density fluctuations of the gas will be enough to convert some regions into a liquid and vice versa.}\relax }}{6}

Figure A contains data at every possible density, but such a dense set of data comes at the cost of computation time.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces \relax \fontsize {8}{9.5}\selectfont \textbf {Here the pivot method is demonstrated. Figure A uses an initial guess to define the zero point for figure B. The local minimums in figure B is used to determine the zero point for figure C. With enough iterations, the pivot method finds a common tangent. The pivot method only requires the use of local minimums and average slopes; this makes the pivot method relatively easy to implement since the typical method requires solving two sets of equations.}\relax }}{18}

Far from the critical point the pivot method works just fine as the signal is relatively strong. Unfortunately near the critical point the signal becomes incredibly weak. To prevent losing the signal, solutions at a slightly lower temperature should be used as guess values at a slightly higher temperature.}\relax }}{19}

The dispersive free energy and internal energy show a minimum near L=7.6, while any box size less than L=8.0 seems to be just fine for the dispersive entropy and heat capacity.
