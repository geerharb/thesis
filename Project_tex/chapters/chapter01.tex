what I did

The liquid-vapor phase coexistence can be found by just placing some liquid into a sealed container. Some of the liquid will evaporate into the jar creating a vapor pressure. Provided we placed enough liquid into the jar, the system will now contain both a liquid and a vapor at the same time. By sealing the liquid into a jar, we have forced the pressure of the liquid to be the as the pressure of the gas. By allowing the atoms to swap between the liquid and gas phase, we have also allowed the chemical potential of the liquid to be the same as that of the gas.

Although we can find the phase coexistence by physically sealing a liquid in a jar, an equivalent computational method is to use an empirically determined fluid model which we can use to run simulations that also equalize the pressure and chemical potential. The problem with the computational method is the empirical model requires fitting a few parameters to data, data which probably already includes points on the phase coexistence curve. The main benefit to the computational approach is that once the empirical parameters are found, we can then create the phase coexistence of a mixture of fluids using the previously determined parameters.

One of the difficulties with the computer simulations is computation time. A simulation with a handful of atoms can be finished within 20 minutes, yet a simulation with a 100 atoms can take as long as 4 days. To recreate the phase coexistence graph requires setting the pressure and chemical potential of both phases equal to each other, but this is equivalent to plotting the free energy as a function of density and searching for a common cotangent. For even a relatively small simulation, the problem is this kind of graph requires many simulations with a handful of atoms to as much as a couple hundred atoms. Total computation time to create the free energy as a function of density graph can take 10 computer cores as long as three weeks for a small simulation.

Naturally there is a tradeoff between a realistic computation time for a project and how realistic the results are going to be. The simulations use periodic boundary conditions which is just the thermodynamic way of saying the boundary should not affect the bulk properties. The key part being whatever is in the simulation is considered the bulk, which is a problem since a small simulation can hardly be considered the bulk. To get around this problem, the simulation size is usually increased until the simulation does represent the bulk.
